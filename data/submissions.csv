This is an Italian song with a bossa Nova beat. Mina is a great singer and the contrast of the male narrator and her is excellent. 

 The song's theme are hollow words. It intertwines the female singer's lamentation of the end of love and the lies she has to hear, while the male actor simply speaks. She reacts and scoffs at the compliments that he gives her, calling them simply empty words – parole. ",91676b2da3f74583b016dc1d585bbfe6
